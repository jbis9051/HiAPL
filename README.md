# HiAPL
*HTML is a programming language*

Inspired by Google listing HTML as a programming language, HTML is becoming a programming language.

# Get Started

Lets starting writing! HiAPL follows basic HTML syntax with tags, attributes, and more!

```html
<console>
    <log>
        <arg>Hello World</arg>
    </log>
</console>
```

## What?

HiAPL (stands for HTML is a programming language) is a new up and coming language that compiles to JavaScript.

## Why?

Why not?

## Where?

Client side and server side. For node, simply look at the import syntax:

**Note:** ES6 import syntax is a planned feature and not available yet. You can use require now.

```html
<head>
    <meta type="import" module="fs">
</head>
<!-- Now You can use the module -->
<text init="true">
  <fs>
    <readFileSync><arg>./text.txt</arg></readFileSync>
  </fs>
</text>
```

## When?

Now, of course. Learn it now.

## How are we making the world a better place?

We are currently in the midst of a pandemic. No, not COVID-19. A global programming language shortage. [Especially](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) [ones](https://coffeescript.org/) [that](https://www.purescript.org/) [compile](https://clojurescript.org/)  [to](https://www.scala-js.org/) [JavaScript](http://vanilla-js.com/). HiAPL aims to solve that problem by creating a single language that can be used for all purposes. Client side web, server side, and native applications. This is accomplished through a concept called "using JavaScript libraries". This concept is discuss more [here](https://www.npmjs.com/).

## You keep saying "HTML". Don't you mean XML?

Oh so you're *that* guy.
