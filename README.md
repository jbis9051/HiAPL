# HiAPL
*HTML is a programming language*

Inspired by Google listing HTML as a programming language, HTML is becoming a programming language.

# Get Started

Let's starting writing! HiAPL follows basic HTML syntax with tags, attributes, and more!

## Logging:
```html
<log><string>Hello World</string></log> <!-- logs Hello World -->
```

## Define Variables
Variables are statically typed. Add your type in the `type` attribute.

```html
<x type="string">Hello World</x>
<log><x/></log> <!-- logs Hello World -->
```
