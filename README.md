# HiAPL
*HTML is a programming language*

Inspired by Google listing HTML as a programming language, HTML is becoming a programming language.

# Get Started

Let's starting writing! HiAPL follows basic HTML syntax with tags, attributes, and more!

## Logging:
```html
<log><string>Hello World</string></log> <!-- logs Hello World -->
```

## Define Variables
Variables are statically typed. Add your type in the `type` attribute.

```html
<x type="string">Hello World</x>
<log><x/></log> <!-- logs Hello World -->
```

# FAQ

## Who?

JBis - the creator

You - the user

## What?

HiAPL (stands for HTML is a programming language) is a new up and coming language that compiles to JavaScript.

## Why?

Why not?

## Where?

Client side and server side. For node, simply look at the import syntax:

```html
<head>
    <meta type="import" module="fs">
</head>
<!-- Now You can use the module -->
<text type="String">
  <fs>
    <readFileSync>./text.txt</readFileSync>
  </fs>
</text>
```

## When?

Now, of course. Learn it now.

## How are we making the world a better place?

We are currently in the midst of a pandemic. No, not COVID-19. A global programming language shortage. [Espcially](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) [ones](https://coffeescript.org/) [that](https://www.purescript.org/) [compile](https://clojurescript.org/)  [to](https://www.scala-js.org/) [JavaScript](http://vanilla-js.com/). HiAPL aims to solve that problem by creating a single langage that can be used for all purposes. Client side web, server side, and native applicaitons. This is accomplished through a concept called "using JavaScript libraries". This concept is discuss more [here](https://www.npmjs.com/).

## You keep saying "HTML". Don't you mean XML?

Oh so you're *that* guy.
